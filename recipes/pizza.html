        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water (45 °C)</li>
            <li>A packet active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 half cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>

                <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
                <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
